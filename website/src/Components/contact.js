                        Welcome to my page, glad you took the time out of your day to pay a visit. Let me talk a little about myself while you're here.
                         I'm 18 years old and was born in Hamilton, Ontario. I come from an Indian background and have been a tech enthusiast my whole life.
                          From building my own PC to creating small robots during my free time. I started my journey at the University of Waterloo for Biomedical
                           Engineering during the fall of 2019. I had decided to settle with this program as it combined my profound interest in technology and engineering 
                           with biology and the human body. Feel free to have a look at some of the more recent projects I have been working on in the projects tab.
                            If you have any questions, my contact information can be found to the left.
